# Smart-factory-system
An IoT-enabled smart factory system using Arduino and sensors to automate and monitor factory operations remotely via cloud platforms, improving efficiency and safety.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring with temperature, ultrasonic, and PIR sensors  
- Automated control using servo and DC motors  
- Data logging and visualization on ThingSpeak and Adafruit IO cloud platforms  
- Alert system with buzzers for critical conditions (e.g., high temperature)  
- Remote access to factory data for timely decision-making  

## Tech Stack
- Arduino Uno  
- Temperature, Ultrasonic, PIR sensors  
- Servo and DC motors for automation  
- ThingSpeak and Adafruit IO for cloud data visualization  

## Usage
1. Sensors collect data from the factory environment.  
2. Data is sent wirelessly to cloud platforms for monitoring.  
3. Motors operate automatically based on sensor inputs.  
4. Alerts notify staff when safety thresholds are exceeded.
